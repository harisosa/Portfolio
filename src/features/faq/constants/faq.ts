    question: "How fast can you deliver a project?",
    answer:
      "It depends on scope, but I usually ship in milestones: a clickable MVP first, then iterate on polish. You’ll get visible progress early (not a “big bang” at the end).",

  },
  {
    id: "7",
    question: "Do you care about performance and SEO, or just visuals?",

    id: "9",
    question: "What’s your approach to building reusable components?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    id: "10",
    question: "How do you handle messy requirements or scope changes?",
    answer:
      "I clarify the goal, lock a minimal success criteria, and keep changes behind small iterations. That way, scope evolves without breaking timelines—or the codebase.",
